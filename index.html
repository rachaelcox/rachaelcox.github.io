<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="/img/profile_031920.png" width="100" />I am a <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/training/funding/f31">Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Fellow</a> and Biochemistry PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin with the Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology.</p>
<p>After getting a BS in Chemistry from Texas A&M in 2013, I spent several years designing and building continous reaction systems for Eastman Chemical Company. Since then, I've decided big molecules are much more interesting than small molecules, so now I study the evolution of protein complexes in the <a href="http://www.marcottelab.org/index.php/Main_Page">Marcotte Lab</a>. I'm passionate about ways we can apply systems biology to improve human health, and my current work focuses on leveraging proteomics data across the tree of life to predict the roles of human proteins in disease.<br style="clear: both;" /></p>

<p>Outside of the lab, I like hiking with my dog Riley, playing cards, trying new craft beers, and reading science fiction.</p>
